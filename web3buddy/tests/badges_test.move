/// Web3Buddy Enhanced Badge System Tests
///
/// This module contains unit tests for the Web3Buddy enhanced badge system.
/// It verifies that the badge system functions correctly, including:
/// - System initialization with predefined quests
/// - Badge minting authorization
/// - Quest validation and tracking
/// - User badge collection management
/// - Error handling for unauthorized actions and duplicates
/// - Error handling for multiple initializations
